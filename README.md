# z88dk-data-in-lower-ram

This is an example of how use the z88dk C compiler suite to create
a ZX Spectrum program which initialises with constant data in lower
memory.

This topic comes up frequently on the z88dk discussion boards because
starting with, for example, level data, in slower, contended memory is a
common thing to want to do.

See the contents of the directories for examples and explanations.

The sdcc directory contains the example written for the zsdcc compiler.

I'll do a sccz80 version when I work out how to do it. Or when someone
shows me. :)
